=======================

This repository includes data needed to create [nextpnr](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) chip database for NG-Ultra architecture from NanoXplore, which is part of project for
providing [an open source FPGA toolchain for a European space-grade FPGA](https://activities.esa.int/4000141380) under a programme of, and funded by, the European Space Agency. ( ESA Contract No. 4000141380/23/NL/GLC/ov ) 

More technical information about NanoXplore architectures is available at their [wiki](https://nanoxplore-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/NAN/overview).

Please note that to generate binary bitstream it is required to use Impulse software from NanoXplore (version 24.2.0.0 or later) and corresponding license.
